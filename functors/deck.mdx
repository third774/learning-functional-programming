# Functors

```notes
Our topic today is: Functors!
```

---

### JS

```js
const items = [1, 2, 3];
const squared = items.map(x => x * x);
// [1, 4, 9]
```

### Python

```python
items = [1, 2, 3]
squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, items))
# [1, 4, 9]
```

```notes
We should probably start with a concrete example that everybody is probably familiar with - map. This is also called Select in LINQ for anyone familiar with C#.

Map is a higher order function that lets us take a list and a function and produce a new list with that transformation applied to each element.

There are a few functor laws that we'll cover today, but structures that have this map operation on it usually are functors.
```

---

### Caveat

Technically, the functor is the transformation itself, not the data structure.

```notes
Quick caveat. In math - the function itself is the functor. In programming, however, we are usually talking about data structures that have this map operation available them.
```

---

```haskell
-- map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map (^2) [1, 2, 3]
-- [1, 3, 9]
map length ["hello", "world!"]
-- [5, 6]
```

```notes
Let's take another look at map but in Haskell and see the type signature. We have an (a -> b) function, and then a list of a's, and we get a list of b's.

So, we don't know anything about types a and b except that they may be different, and we have that (a -> b) function.
We could be taking a list of users and producing a list of their first names. We could take a list of numbers and square them.

Note here, that while the types contained within the array can change, it MUST still be an array.
```

---

```haskell
fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

```notes
Now imagine that instead of having a list of a's, we make the list generic as well. Let's call it f. This is called a higher kinded type, by the way.

So, f here could be a list, but there are also many other things it could be. But lists are definitely the most common thing everyone has probably worked with.

So if we previously had a list of a, let's now say that we have an "f of a". This is of course, pretty strange. Most languages don't allow these higher kinded types.

If 'f' were fully polymorphic here, we actually wouldn't be able to do anything with the 'a' though. Knowing that the 'f' type is parameterized by the 'a' type doesn't do us any good if we don't know how to interact with it.

So all functors MUST implement this fmap method. Think of it as an interface. So, let's take a look at the implementation of fmap for lists.
```

---

```haskell
instance Functor [] where
    fmap = map
```

```notes
So, uh - it's just map! The same map we know and love. Let's see what it would look like though if we needed to implement it ourselves.
```

---

```haskell
-- (:) :: a -> [a] -> [a]
-- e.g. head : [tail, is, the, rest, of, the, list]
-- produces [head, tail, is, the, rest, of, the, list]

-- fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
instance Functor [] where
    fmap f []       = []
    fmap f (x : xs) = f x : fmap f xs
```

```notes
I've included the type signature of fmap and the cons operator above for reference here. So remember, it's an (a -> b) function, an "f of a", and produces an "f of b"

The implementation here is pretty simple, right? The first line is our case where we are handling an empty list. We cannot possibly apply the function, so we just return an empty list.

On the second line, we handle the non-empty list case. We destructure the list with the cons operator - that colon. The 'x' on the left becomes the head of the list - the first element. And the 'xs' becomes the tail of the list - the rest of the items in the list.

So we apply the 'f' function (which is our a to b function) to the x, then use the cons operator again to join the result to the front of an array. And what do we use for the rest of the array here? We call fmap recursively on the tail, and the rest will be taken care of!
```

---

```haskell
-- fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
instance Functor Maybe where
    fmap f Nothing  = Nothing
    fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)
```

```notes
How about the implementation for Maybe? Well, you'll see here it's also pretty simple.

First we handle the Nothing case. The implementation here returns Nothing, but... does it have to? Could we return anything else? ... Nope! We don't know how to construct a value to wrap in a Just. We must return Nothing.

Next we'll handle the Just case. We destructure the x out of the Just value here, apply f to the x, and wrap it back up in a Just
```

## Compose Refresher

```haskell
-- Mathematical notation: f ∘ g

-- Compose in Haskell
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
f . g = \\x -> f (g x)

stringHasEvenLength = even . length
stringHasEvenLength' = (==0) . (`mod`2) . length
```

```notes
Before we talk about the functor laws, it's probably worth doing a quick refresher on compose.

The idea is we have two functions and want to sort of glue them together. We have an (a -> b) function, and a (b -> c) function, and we want to create an (a -> c) function

In other languages, this is the pipe operator. In haskell, this is the dot operator. It is based on mathematical function composition, which uses that little circle. The mathematical notation is read as "f after g", which you could interpret as "we are going to take a value, pass it through function g, then take the resulting value, and pass it through f"

And that's exactly how it is implemented. You can see the implementation of compose here. The type signature first takes f which is our (b -> c) function, then g which is our (a -> b) function, and returns an (a -> c) function. We return a lambda function that takes the value x (of type a) and passes that first into g which is our (a -> b) function, then the result goes into f which is our (b -> c) function.

[GO OVER EXAMPLES]
```

## Functors Laws

<List>
  <ListItem>
    If you map Identity over a functor, you get back the exact same functor
  </ListItem>
  <ListItem>
    If you compose two functions (f & g) together and map that over a functor,
    it's the same as mapping f and then mapping g over the functor
  </ListItem>
</List>

```notes
So, functor laws.

The first one is that if we map the Identity function over a functor, we will get back the same functor. It would be the same as just passing the functor through the Identity function.

The second is that if you compose function f with function g together and map the resulting function over a functor, it's the same as mapping f and then mapping g over your function.

This second law is especially useful for example if you have multiple transformations you want to perform on each element in a list and don't want to iterate over the list multiple times. You can compose the functions together and then map that over the list.
```

# Things that aren't functors

## (but could be?)

---

```haskell
(a, b) -- can be re-written as (,) a b
Map a b
a -> b -- can be re-written as (->) a b
```

```notes
So, it is important to note here that these types: tuples, maps, and functions (at least in this form) cannot be functors. Why? Because they are parameterized by TWO types. So it would be an "f of a, b"

If you look closely at these types though, you may notice they kinda look like functions with arguments, right?
```

---

```haskell
(a, b) -- can be re-written as (,) a b
Map a b
a -> b -- can be re-written as (->) a b
-- Example function:
addTwoNumbers 1 2 -- produces 3
```

```notes
Here's an example function for reference. We just have the function name. "addTwoNumbers" is just the plus operator here with an alias. We apply those arguments with spaces in between, and we get 3 as a result.

So the types up above - these are actually called Type Constructors, and they work just like functions in that they can have types partially applied.
```

---

```haskell
:kind (,) -- (,) :: * -> * -> *
:kind (,) Int -- (,) Int :: * -> *
:kind (,) Int Char -- (,) Int Char :: *
```

```notes
In the haskell repl, you can use this :kind command and give it a type to see the "kind" of a type. If a type has parameters that are fully applied,
```

---

```haskell
(a, b) -- can be re-written as (,) a b
Map a b
a -> b -- can be re-written as (->) a b
```

```notes
So if we come back to these types that are parameterized by more than one type, and we partially apply one of the types, we can treat it as a functor.

For exmaple, we can treat Map as a functor if we partially apply the key type such that our fmap implementation ignores the key type and simply applies the function to the values.
```

---

```haskell
bimap :: Bifunctor p => (a -> b) -> (c -> d) -> p a c -> p b d
```

```notes
if you don't partially apply a type, you have what's called a bi-functor. It is similar to functor, as the name would imply, but you can see based on the type signature here that we need to supply two functions. One for each type we'll be transforming.

So, given an (a -> b) function and a (c -> d) function, and a "p of a, c", we can produce a "p of b, d"
```

---

## What if we partially apply a type to (->) a b?

### Can we turn functions into functors?

```notes
So, let's start wandering off into some bind bending territory.
```

---

```haskell
((->) r) a
-- becomes
f a
```

```notes
I've changed the types here from (a -> b) to (r -> a) to fit nicely with where we're going, but these names don't matter, just the fact that they are different from eachother.

If we apply a fully polymorphic type to 'r' here we can turn turn "(->) r" into "f of a"! This looks like a functor, right?
```

---

```haskell
((->) r) a
-- becomes
f a

fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

```notes
Now let's look at fmap again. We need an (a -> b) function for our first argument. The second argument will be a function that takes type "r" and produces an a - we don't care what "r" is, it can be fully polymorphic here because we know its output will be what? "a"!

So, we've taken an (r -> a) function, and an (a -> b) function, and we've made an (r -> b) function.

Doesn't this look familiar? This is compose!
```

---

# 🤯

## Compose is fmap

## for functions

```haskell
instance Functor (->) where
    fmap = (.)
```

```notes
Compose is fmap for functions! This really blew my mind.
```

---

```haskell
stringHasEvenLength = even . length
stringHasEvenLength' = fmap even length

:t fmap even length
-- fmap even length :: Foldable t => t a -> Bool
```

```notes
So here, we can see the type signature for the composed stringHasEvenLength function. It takes a Foldable t of a (input type of length), and returns a boolean (the output type of even). Nowhere in this signature do we see that a number is involved.
```

---

# We're about to jump the shark

---

### What if we have a functor inside another functor and want to apply some transformation to the inner value(s)?

```haskell
[Just 3, Nothing, Just 4]
-- How could we apply (*2) to the list of maybes?
[[1,2], [3,4]]
-- How could we apply (*2) to the list of lists?
```

---

```haskell
doubleFmap = fmap . fmap
-- or
doubleFmap' = fmap fmap fmap
```

```notes
Remember how fmap is compose for functions? Well, since fmap is a function, we can compose two fmaps together. And since compose IS fmap for functions, we can say "fmap fmap fmap"
```

---

```haskell
doubleFmap :: (Functor f1, Functor f2) => (a -> b) -> f1 (f2 a) -> f1 (f2 b)
```

```notes
Here's what the type signature looks like. This certainly looks like it would do the job, right? We have two different functors, f1 and f2, an (a -> b) function, and given an f1 of f2 of a, we can produce an f1 of f2 of b.

Does it work?
```

---

```haskell
doubleFmap (*2) [Just 3, Nothing, Just 4]
-- [Just 6, Nothing, Just 8]

doubleFmap (*2) Just [1, 2, 3]
-- Just [2, 4, 6]
```

```notes
Heck yeah it does! If we run it with that list of maybes, it does the job perfectly. We can even swap the functors and it still works.

So, this is pretty cool! This works with any combination of functors!
```

---

```haskell
fmap fmap fmap

--                     fmap      fmap
fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
-- second fmap becomes  (a    ->       b)
fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> (f a -> f b)
-- third fmap becomes (f a) and we get back (f b)
fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

```notes
So, how does this work? I'm still trying to get my head around it fully, but I've identified this much.

If we look at the type signature of fmap, we can see that the second fmap becomes the (a -> b) function, and the second fmap becomes the f of a.

On the second type signature line there I've added some parens around the (f of a -> f of b) for clarity of what b is here. The parens being in this position doesn't change the meaning of the expression.

Also, the a here in f of a has to be the output of the function since we've had to paritally apply all other types in the function's type constructor to make it fit as a functor. So we're taking an f1 of f2 of a and wrapping up the f1 of f2 part into a single type and calling that f.
```
