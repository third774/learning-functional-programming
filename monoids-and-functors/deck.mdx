# Monoids

```notes
Today is going to be our first foray into the "scary" sounding parts of FP. We're going to talk about monoids!

They're actually not that hard to understand as you'll hopefully see by the end here. Most typed languages don't have a type system that can express these concepts in the type signature of a function (Haskell, Idris, probably some other FP languages), but they're still useful to understand and build an intuition for the value that they bring and how those concepts could be applied to something you may be working on.

There is a pretty small set of these core concepts in category theory that can get you really far ‚Äî similar to how map/filter/reduce make up a core of higher order functions that can let you do dang near anything to a list. So ‚Äî once you learn these core types, you'll see that these will cover most of the patterns you will see within programming.

So ‚Äî¬†let's get started!
```

### A quick word about

# Category Theory

```notes
First - a quick word about Category Theory. It is based on abstract mathematics which is sort of like the mathematics that describes why aritmatic works. Why math has the rules that it does.

These ideas were extracted from concrete things in aritmatic ‚Äî and then once made abstract and generalized it was fairly obvious that it also applies to this thing ‚Äî and that thing ‚Äî and that thing.

What would appear to be a disjoint set of concepts can all be unified at least in some aspect under a certain categorical abstraction.

So ‚Äî Category Theory arose to describe the patterns seen in abstract mathematics and then when some people who were into Category Theory got into programming, they noticed that some of the things they were doing in programming were patterns they had already seen before. It became clear that these concepts extended beyond math.

Functional programming languages were then built around those ideas to give them first class support.
```

---

### First let's learn about

# Semigroups

```notes
Before we get to monoids, let's talk about Semigroups. Once we've established an understanding of semi-groups, monoids will be just one small step further.

A Semigroup can be described as:
A data type which has an operation that allows you to take two elements of that type and combine them together to get another element of that type.
```

---

### A data type that has an

## "Append" operation

```haskell
(<>) :: Semigroup a => a -> a -> a
```

```notes
Haskell has an operator for this - less than followed by greater than. This is a function that has a constraint that says type 'a' needs to be a Semigroup. It will take an 'a' and second 'a' and return an 'a'.

Concatenating two lists is a concrete example of this. We take a list, we take another list, and we produce a list as a result.

The append operation defined for a certain data type IS what says that data type is a semi-group because there is this operation that is available for this type.

Simple enough so far? Let's look at some examples.
```

---

## We can combine lists

```haskell
"abc" <> "def" == "abcdef"
[1,2,3] <> [4,5,6] == [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

```notes
So - we see here we can concatenate lists and strings which are just lists of characters. Anything you would think of concatenating together is almost certainly a semigroup.
```

---

## We can combine numbers

### (in more than one way)

```haskell
3 + 4 == 7
3 * 4 == 12

```

```notes
Now, with numbers, there are two different ways that they can be combined that were interested in today - addition and multiplication.

These are separate semigroups. You would say these are "Integers under addition" as one, and "Integers under multiplication" as the other.
```

---

#### because we don't know the operation

### we can't just say 3 <> 4

```haskell
Sum 3 <> Sum 4 == Sum 7
Product 3 <> Product 4 == Product 12
```

```notes
So, we can't just say 3 append 4 with numbers because there is more than one way to combine them, right?

In order to use our append (<>) operation here, we need to wrap these numbers in a data-type that implements that append operation for the data type, so we use these Sum and Product data constructors where each data type will have its own implementation of the <> function, which will be + and * respectively.
```

---

### A Semigroup's append must obey the

## Law of Associativity

```haskell
x <> (y <> z) == (x <> y) <> z (Semigroup law)
```

```notes
Semigroups must follow the law of associativity. This means that the order in which the "append" operation is applied does not matter. Note that this does NOT mean you can just move x, y, and z around freely. Their positions cannot change. If they were allowed to move like that we would say they are commutative.

But you can see here based on these parentheses that we can first apply append to y and z, then take that result and combine it with x - and that should give use the same result as first combining x and y, then combining that with z

Mathematical laws like this typically cannot be enforced by the compiler, so there is some level of responsibility here on the programmer to ensure this law is followed.

You could use something like "Agda" which is a theorem prover to write proofs for these if you wanted, but most languages cannot express this kind of requirement.
```

---

## Semigroups (recap)

<List>
  <ListItem>Have an "append" operation for their data type</ListItem>
  <ListItem>The append operation obeys the Law of Associativity</ListItem>
  <ListItem>That's it! Not so bad, right?</ListItem>
</List>

```notes
So, to recap on Semigroups:

REVEALS

That is the end for Semigroups.
```

---

# What is it good for?

```haskell
Semigroup a :: [a] -> ???
```

```notes
Let's say you have a list of type "a". The only thing you know about a is that it's a Semigroup, so we know we have this append operation.

What can we do with the list of those things?

- We can append them together
- We could reduce them all down together
- Do you have to combine them in order?
- If we had a really big list - let's say a million items - knowing this is associative - is there a way we could divide and conquer this thing?
- Split this into n sublists, have each sublist combine their respective results, then combine the results of those
```

---

# Producing a single value

```haskell
Semigroup a :: [a] -> a
```

```notes
We know that's safe to do _because_ of the law of associativity. We know nothing about type a, but we're already talking about parallelizing it across multiple threads, and we know that's safe to do. And this works for _anything_ that is a Semigroup.

So when we talk about "getting stuff for free" in terms of reasoning, this is what we're talking about. If you know that something is a Semigroup, you automatically know some pretty useful things that can be done with things of that type.

Associativity seems like this very innocuous thing, but it is very powerful. It's still not obvious to me in many ways.
```

---

## What about receiving them asynchronously?

```notes
Could we receive these Semigroup elements asynchronously and collect them? Is that safe?

Could we have an infinite stream of them?

Could we process them while they're coming in?

We could buffer them, batch them together, and then append them. We could maybe wait until we get ten of them and then process them together? A stream of chunks?

We now know a few really neat things we can do with a very tiny little bit of information. All because of our ability to append them together and the law of associativity.
```

# Monoid

### has one additional rule

```notes
A monoid is a Semigroup with one thing added.
```

---

### A Monoid is a

### Semigroup that has an

## Identity value

```haskell
-- value <> identity
[1,2,3] <> [] == [1,2,3]
```

```notes
It has a value called "identity" that is sort of the "empty" value for that data type. Meaning ‚Äî if you "append" the identity value to some other value, you get the some other value back unchanged.

You may recall we previously discussed the identity function - it just takes a value and returns it unchanged. Well, functions that go from a -> a are actually a monoid, and the identity function is the identity value for that Monoid. More on that later.
```

---

## Other examples

```haskell
-- value <> identity
"abc" <> "" == "abc"
Sum 3 <> Sum 0 == Sum 3
Product 5 <> Product 1 == Product 5
```

```notes
So - here are some more examples. Again, strings are just arrays of characters, so an empty string here makes sense as the identity value.

Sum is 0 since adding 0 doesn't change the number. Product is 1 since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the number.
```

---

## Monoids

<List>
  <ListItem>Are semigroups that have an identity value</ListItem>
  <ListItem>Identity must be commutative</ListItem>
</List>

```notes
So, recapping monoids ‚Äî

They're semigroups that have an identity value

And the identity value must be commutative. It shouldn't matter where you combine in the identity value. It should have no effect regardless.
```

---

## So what can we do with Monoids?

### (That we couldn't do with Semigroups)

```notes
So, what can we do with monoids that we couldn't do with Semigroups?

Remember our list of a where a is a Semigroup from earlier and we said we could combine them all down into a single element?

We know we can do that whole divide and conquer strategy, or one at a time, or asynchronously?

There is a specific list in which this will fail.

An empty list ‚Äî¬†how do you return an a from an empty list of a?
```

---

# ~~Producing a single value~~

```haskell
Semigroup a :: [a] -> a -- ILLEGAL!
Semigroup a :: [a] -> a -> a -- 'a' in the middle is an initial value
```

```notes
Remember this slide? This type signature is actually illegal. Similar to how the "head" function cannot return the first a in an empty list of a's, we cannot produce an a value by combining all of the a's in an empty list of a's
```

---

## You can fold/reduce a Monoid

## without providing an initial value.

```notes
So, with a monoid, you can fold or reduce a monoid using its append operation without providing an initial value.

We can safely assume the initial value to be the identity value for that monoid since appending against it will not change the meaning of the first thing we append to it.

So - this allows us to take any kind of collection thing that is "monoidal" instead of just a Semigroup, and we can always concatenate them all the way down. We don't have to worry about special cases for not having a value like an empty list.

```

---

```haskell
mconcat :: Monoid a => [a] -> a
mconcat = foldr '(<>)' mempty
```

```notes
And so there is a special fold that works on Monoids that doesn't take the initial value because it already has it. That initial value is just called "empty" (mempty in Haskell) within the context of the monoid.

What would happen if we were to use this function with an empty list of integers under addition? We'd get 0. The identity value.

How about multiplication? We'd get 1. The identity value.

What about an empty list of lists of integers? (result would be an empty list)
```

---

# Less obvious Monoids

```notes
So far we've talked about some of the more obvious monoids. Now that you have an understanding of what they are, let's look at some less obvious examples.
```

---

# Booleans?

```notes
Take a data type like a boolean for example, and let's look at it under a different lens. Remember we looked at numbers under addition and multiplication, and those turned out to be two separate Monoids?

Could we do something similar with booleans?

What operations do we have available to combine them?

With && and || we can combine them ‚Äî we've got a Semigroup!
Now, let's pick && for a moment. Does && have an identity value? What about ||?
```

---

```haskell
-- identity <> value
All True <> All False == All False
All True <> All True == All True
True && False == False
True && True == True

Any False <> Any True == Any True
Any False <> Any False == Any False
False || True == True
False || False == False
```

```notes
It does! True will not change the other value you combine with it using &&.

You can see here that True is the identity value for All type. If you combine it with a False you get back a False. If you combine it with a True you get back True.

Inversely, False is the identity for the Any type. If you combine it with a True you get back a True. If you combine it with a False you get back False.

So, booleans under the "or" operator are monoids, and so are booleans under the "and" operator!
```

---

## Can functions be Monoids? ü§î

```notes
Can you take any two functions regardless of type signature and glue them together? No ‚Äî if you have an (a -> b) function and a (c -> d) function, how can you compose them together?¬†So with no constrains, we cannot say functions are monoids.

Is there a type signature for functions we know we can always glue together as long as they match that type signature?

What about (Int -> Int) functions? Can I take any two (Int -> Int) functions and glue them together? Can you compose those?
- We can compose those, so it is a Semigroup.

Is there an identity value? Is it a monoid?

What about the identity function?
- It does not have an effect when composed!
```

---

## (a -> a) is a Monoid ü§Ø

```haskell
-- compose is . or the "dot operator"
compose :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
compose f g x = f (g x)
<> = compose -- could also just be writted as <> = (.)

identity :: a -> a
identity a = a
mempty = identity
```

```notes
This one blew my mind. Functions that go from a to a under the "compose" operation are monoids.

You can see the compose operation here takes two functions here (f and g) and produces another function. That function is going to take x as a value and call g with it, then pass the result into f.

The reason it has (b -> c) and (a -> b) types shown here is because compose is useful outside of the context of Monoids, and so it can support functions that do change types, but we can plug (a -> a) functions in here and it works the same.
```

```haskell
identity :: a -> a
identity a = a

doSomeMath :: Int -> Int
doSomeMath = identity . (+3) . (*2)

doSomeMath 4 == 11
```

```notes
Here we can see a concrete example of this. We can compose (*2) with (+3) and then compose that with identity, and we get back a function that will first multiply by 2, then add three, then it goes through identity and comes right back out.
```
